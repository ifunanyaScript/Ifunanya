### Hi there 👋, My name is Favour

<!--
I am an intermediate Data Scientist. After several months of learning the science of data manipulation, data analysis and Machine Learning, I decided to take up this division of the tech industry as a career. 
Digging into Data, and fetching insightful information from analysis is something I enjoy doing. I've worked on series of personal projects, that  helped build my skill sets. I'm young, and very passionate about discovering and unraveling.
I'd be delighted to uncover details and insights that would aid full comprehension of your data to help you take shrewd decisions that would bring light to your enterprise.
